# nsconn V2.0
A connector for the NeuroSky Mindwave Mobile 2 EEG headset. Nsconn is designed to emulate the functionality of the official ThinkGear connector, but with the added UNIX friendly bonus of printing to stdout (can be used with grep, output to a file etc). \
If networking is specified, clients can connect to nsconn via a client socket on 127.0.0.1:9291 to begin recieving JSON headset data.\

For further usage information please check the man page.

# Installation:

git clone https://github.com/SWelshUWS/nsconn \
cd nsconn \
sudo apt update \
sudo chmod +x install \
sudo ./install 

Before using nsconn, please change the configuration file at /etc/nsconn.conf DEFAULT_MAC to use your own headset. Alternatively, a MAC can be specified as the last argument when starting up nsconn.
